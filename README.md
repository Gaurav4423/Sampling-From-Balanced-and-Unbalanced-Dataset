# Sampling From Balanced and Unbalanced Dataset


In this, we will be using different Sampling Techniques to construct a balanced dataset from an unbalanced dataset containing CreditCard Information.

#### To balance the dataset given techniques were used:
1. Random UnderSampling
2. Random OverSampling
3. SMOTE Sampling
4. ADASYN Sampling
5. NearMiss

### To predict the accuracy of prediction following models were used:
1. AdaBoostClassifier
2. RandomForestClassifier
3. ExtraTreesClassifier
4. GradientBoostingClassifier
5. XGBClassifier

### Inferences

The Above Table shows that the maximum Accuracy achieved is 0.9935 which is obtained by various models under various sampling Techniques.
